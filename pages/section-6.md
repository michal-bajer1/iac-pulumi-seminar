### Digital Twins of Infrastructure
- 1:1 mapping with real resources
- Real-time state tracking
- Immediate feedback loop

### Reactive Programming Model
- Infrastructure as reactive functions
- Real-time validation
- Built-in state management

### Collaborative Design
- Real-time multiplayer experience
- Role-specific interfaces
- Built-in visualization

# Different Solutions Emerging

## Infrastructure Languages
<v-clicks>

### Wing Language
- Purpose-built for cloud
- Built-in cloud patterns
- Type-safe resource handling
```typescript
bring cloud;
let api = new cloud.Api();
let bucket = new cloud.Bucket();
```

### CDKTF
- Infrastructure in familiar languages
- Strong typing
- IDE integration
```typescript
const bucket = new s3.Bucket(this, 'MyBucket', {
  versioned: true,
  removalPolicy: RemovalPolicy.DESTROY
});
```

### Nickel
- Configuration language
- Strong type system
- Built for cloud configuration
