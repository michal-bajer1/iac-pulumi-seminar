Key Points to Cover:

1. Traditional Process (Left diagram)
   - Teams submitting tickets
   - Manual review/approval cycles
   - Weeks of waiting time
   - No visibility into progress
   - High process overhead
   - Impact on team velocity

2. Platform Evolution (Right diagram)
   - Self-service capabilities
   - Automated validation
   - Minutes vs weeks
   - Clear feedback loops
   - Built-in standards
   - Team empowerment

3. Key Benefits
   - Speed of delivery
   - Team autonomy
   - Standardization
   - Predictable outcomes
   - Better developer experience

Questions to Drive Engagement:
- "What problems do you see in the traditional approach?"

- "Where might human review still be valuable?"

Real World Connection:
- Share Mews journey between these models
- Reference familiar tools (GitHub, Azure Portal)
- Connect to their project experiences
- Discuss modern DevOps practices

Transition to Next Slides:
- "These benefits sound great, but achieving them brings its own challenges..."

# The Evolution Steps
From raw resources to developer experience

::left::

## Raw Pulumi
```csharp
// Direct Azure resource creation
var database = new Database(
    name: resourceName,
    args: new DatabaseArgs
    {
        ResourceGroupName = resourceGroup.Name,
        ServerName = server.Name,
        Location = location.Id,
        Sku = new SkuArgs
        {
            Name = "Standard",
            Tier = "Standard",
            Capacity = db.Dtu
        }
    },
    options: new CustomResourceOptions
    {
        Protect = protectFromDeletion
    }
);
```

::right::

## Low-Level SDK
```csharp
// Wrapped with better defaults
var database = AzureSqlDatabase.Create(
    resourceName: resourceName,
    databaseName: databaseName,
    resourceGroup: resourceGroup,
    location: location,
    server: server,
    tier: new StandardDb(50),
    readScaleOut: DatabaseReadScale.Enabled,
    zoneRedundant: true,
    protectFromDeletion: true
);
```

        Location: location,
        AdminLogin: builder.GetString("sql-server-admin-login"),
        AdminPassword: new OutputValueSource(builder.GetSecret("sql-server-admin-password"))

    ZoneRedundancy: false,
    HighAvailabilityReplicaCount: 0,
