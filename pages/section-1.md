# Infrastructure Evolution

## Track 1: Infrastructure Management
<v-clicks>

- Physical Servers (2000s)
  - Manual configuration
  - Physical hardware constraints
  - Weeks to provision
  - Server-to-admin ratio ~10:1

- Virtualization Revolution (Late 2000s)
  - Better resource utilization
  - Days to provision
  - Server-to-admin ratio ~100:1

- Cloud Era (Early 2010s)
  - On-demand resources
  - Minutes to provision
  - Server-to-admin ratio ~500:1

- Infrastructure as Code (Late 2010s)
  - Programmable infrastructure
  - Seconds to provision
  - Server-to-admin ratio ~1000:1

# The Pets vs Cattle Revolution

## Pets Approach (Traditional)
<v-clicks>

- Named servers ("Zeus", "Apollo")
- Individual care and maintenance
- Manual recovery procedures
- Emergency fixes common
- High operational overhead

</v-clicks>

## Cattle Approach (Modern)
<v-clicks>

- Numbered resources ("web-042")
- Standardized management
- Automatic replacement
- Process-driven operations
- Scalable maintenance

</v-clicks>

<!--
