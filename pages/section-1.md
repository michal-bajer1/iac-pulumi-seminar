# Evolution of Infrastructure & Systems

<div class="opacity-80 italic mb-4">
Two parallel revolutions that shaped modern computing
</div>

<!--
# Speaker Notes
- Little bit of history to explain where IaC comes from
- Two main trends in the last 20 years
- They both lead to increase of complexity in our infrastructure

# Infrastructure Evolution Timeline
Major shifts in how we manage infrastructure over decades


```mermaid
timeline
    title Infrastructure Management Journey
    section 2000s
        Physical Era : Manual Operations
        : Datacenter Hardware
        : Weeks to Deploy
    section Late 2000s
        Virtualization : VMware & Hypervisors
        : Template-based
        : Days to Deploy
    section Early 2010s

# Speaker Notes

Key points to highlight:
- Each era brings order of magnitude improvement
- Provision time: Weeks ‚Üí Seconds (10000x faster)
- Scale: 10 ‚Üí 1000+ servers (100x capacity)

Questions for engagement:
- "What technological changes enabled each jump?"
- "Why did organizations need this scale?"
- "What skills were needed at each stage?"

# Systems Architecture Evolution
How software systems grew in complexity and scale

```mermaid
timeline
    title Software Systems Evolution
    section Early 2000s
        Monolithic : Single Application
        : One Database
        : Simple Deploy
    section Mid 2000s
        Service-Oriented : Multiple Services
        : Multiple Databases
        : Coordinated Deploy
    section 2010s
        Cloud Native : Microservices
        : Distributed Data
        : Container Deploy
        : Kubernetes
    section 2020s
        Modern : Serverless & Containers
        : Many services, many databases
        : Multi-cloud
        : Continuous Deployments
```

# Key System Characteristics

<v-clicks>

- Monolithic: One team, one deploy, one database
- Service-Oriented: Multiple teams, coordinated deploys
- Cloud Native: Many small services, continuous deployment
- Modern: Mix of serverless, containers, and cloud services

</v-clicks>

<div v-click class="mt-12 text-center text-xl">

üí° More Components = More Infrastructure Complexity

</div>

<!--
# Speaker Notes

Expand on each point:
- Monolithic: Like your early one person projects - simple stack
- SOA: Teams start interfering with each other, need coordination
- Cloud Native: Kubernetes entered the scene and more complex automated orchestration becomes accesible
- Modern: Mix of approaches based on needs

Additional context to mention:
- Each stage requires more automation
- Manual processes don't scale
- Teams need independence
- Configuration becomes critical

Key message: Infrastructure complexity follows system complexity - this is why we need better tools and practices.

Question to ask: "What architectures have you seen and worked with?"

# Speaker Notes

Key message: Fundamental shift in how we think about servers

Additional context to mention:
- Pets: We care for them individually, nurse them back to health
- Cattle: Replaceable, automated management
- Like your laptop (pet) vs a Docker container (cattle)
- This mindset shift enabled modern cloud scaling

Question: "Which approach do you use in your projects?"

# Speaker Notes

Interaction approach:
- Ask for raised hands
- Note the distribution of experience
- Use this to adjust upcoming examples

Look for:
- AWS/Azure experience for examples
- Prior automation experience
- Tools they're familiar with
- Which concepts need more explanation
-->
